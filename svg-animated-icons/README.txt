 A series of animated svg icons we did for a contest on Codecanyon.  
they have an optional hover effect and you can edit the colours of the palette with css by changing the 4 "bm_color_" selectors 
CSS classes were directly set and exported from After Effects.  
All animations gzipped weight 50k and the player weights 20k  
All 20 icons + player total 70kb gzipped
